# Excel-Data-Cleaning-Movies-Dataset

# Project Overview

This document outlines the data cleaning process for the movies dataset using Excel.

## Data Sources

The movies dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). It contains metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset, released on or before July 2017. 

## Tools

The data cleaning process was conducted using Microsoft Excel.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved the following activities:

1. **Auto Fitting Columns**: Ensured that all data in each column is fully visible, preventing truncated data and facilitating easier analysis.

2. **Filling Empty Cells with NA**: Replaced empty cells with "NA" to standardize missing values, making it easier to identify and handle them during analysis.

3. **Removing Trailing and Leading Spaces**: Eliminated extra spaces before or after the text in cells, ensuring consistency and accuracy in data comparison and analysis.

4. **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate entries, preventing potential bias in analysis and ensuring accuracy in statistical calculations.

5. **Formatting**: Applied consistent formatting to data fields such as dates, currency, and text, enhancing readability and facilitating accurate analysis.
